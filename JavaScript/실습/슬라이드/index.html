                    “The backs of the seats were thrown back, bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious
                    system, berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller had soon at his disposition a
                    comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thick curtains. The sheets were clean and the
                    pillows soft. It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did—while the train sped on
                    across the State of California.”

                    “The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along the American
                    River, which empties into San Pablo Bay. The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were
                    accomplished in six hours, and towards midnight, while fast asleep, the travellers passed through
                    Sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important place, the seat of the State government, with
                    its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels, squares, and churches.”

                    “The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the
                    range of the Sierra Nevada. 'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the
                    dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the picturesque
                    beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming. The railway track wound in and out
                    among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt
                    angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet. The locomotive,
                    its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a
                    spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its
                    smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines.”

                    mountains, and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to
                    another.”
